# SchoolDream User Management Feature Documentation

## Overview

The User Management component is a core administrative module in the SchoolDream platform, responsible for comprehensive user lifecycle management across all stakeholder roles (administrators, teachers, parents, and students). It provides centralized control over user accounts, ensuring secure access, role-based permissions, and seamless integration with the platform's authentication and authorization systems.

### Purpose
- **Primary Goal**: Enable administrators to efficiently manage user accounts, enforce security policies, and maintain accurate user data for the entire institution.
- **Key Objectives**: Facilitate bulk operations, track user activities, automate provisioning, and provide granular access controls to support the platform's multi-role ecosystem.
- **Scope**: Covers user creation, modification, deletion, role assignment, activity monitoring, and integration with Supabase Auth for secure authentication.

### Target Users
- **School Administrators**: Manage institutional user accounts and permissions.
- **IT Administrators**: Oversee security policies and technical access controls.
- **Department Heads**: Handle role assignments for their teams.

### Integration with SchoolDream Platform
- **Authentication Bridge**: Leverages Supabase Auth for secure login/logout; integrates with Admin Dashboard for user metrics.
- **Role-Based Access**: Supports RBAC across all modules (Teacher, Parent, Student); affects feature visibility and permissions.
- **Data Flow**: User data feeds into Academic Management, Communication Hub, and Reports & Analytics.
- **AI Integration**: User activity data informs AI Learning Companion personalization and Predictive Analytics.

## Database Schema

### Table Structures
- **users** (extends auth.users):
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name TEXT,
    role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'teacher', 'parent', 'student')) NOT NULL,
    department TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'suspended')),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

- **user_activity**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE user_activity (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    details JSONB,
    ip_address INET,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

- **bulk_imports**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE bulk_imports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    file_name TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'processing',
    processed_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    error_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

### Relationships
- Users linked to auth.users; activity logs reference users.
- Bulk imports track import jobs.

### Constraints and Indexes
- Unique email index; role and status checks.
- Indexes on user_id in activity table for fast queries.

### Migrations
- Initial schema creation; add columns for future features (e.g., profile_picture).

## UI/UX Design

### Wireframes
- **User List Page**: Data table with filters, search bar, bulk action buttons.
- **User Detail Modal**: Form for create/edit with role dropdown, validation messages.
- **Bulk Import Dialog**: File upload, preview table, progress bar.
- **Activity Dashboard**: Timeline view with filters.

### Component Hierarchy
- **UserManagementPage**: Main container.
  - **UserTable**: Data grid with sorting/filtering.
  - **UserForm**: Modal form for CRUD.
  - **BulkActions**: Toolbar for import/export.
  - **ActivityPanel**: Sidebar for logs.

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast.
- Screen reader support for tables and forms.

### Responsive Design Principles
- Mobile: Stacked layout, swipe actions.
- Tablet: Compact tables.
- Desktop: Full grid with side panels.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Mechanisms
- Supabase Auth with JWT; MFA via TOTP/SMS.
- Session management with automatic logout.

### Data Encryption
- TLS 1.3 for transmission; AES-256 at rest.
- Password hashing with bcrypt.

### GDPR Compliance
- Data minimization; right to erasure; consent management.
- Audit logs for access tracking.

### Vulnerability Mitigations
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries.
- XSS protection with input sanitization.
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints.
